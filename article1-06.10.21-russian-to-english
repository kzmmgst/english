==Coronavirus is again messing up plans to build an AK rifle factory in Venezuela==

Reported from Moscow, on 6 Oct, 2021, INTERFAX.RU

Construction of the plant for production of AK rifles should conclude in 2022, but the coronavirus is making the situation 
more complicated, an Interfax interviewee from the national defense industry said.

Yesterday a special envoy of the President of Venezuela Adan Chavez declared intention to build the aforementioned factory with
mid-2022 deadline, and he also expressed hope that, that nothing's going to mess up with the construction team's plans this time.

"The issue right now is to end the construction in 2022", he confirmed and noted that their party has to deal with coronavirus
situation right now.

"We should send many specialists and inspectors there, so that after the construction is done, which is also to be inspected, we can
start it up", he explained

The then presidents of Russia and Venezuela, Putin and Hugo Chavez, agreed in 2006 to build two plants for licenced AK rifle and AK 7.62mm
ammunition production in Venezuela. Construction site opened in 2009 but since then many government officials complained it got to standstill.

On Aug 24, 2021, the director of "Rosoboronexport" (Russian defense export commitee) Aleksandr Mikheev told "Interfax", that the two AK plants
are still being built and that they are approaching the final stage of construction work.

On Jun 3, 2021, an Interfax informant said that the construction is nearly 80% done. The informant, based in Caracas, also complained that
due to the coronavirus the construction slowed down, and that it has also negatively influenced the staff and the building material logistics
times.

Venezuela is the largest buyer of Russian weapons and military equipment in Latin America. Russia also made a state loan to Venezuela for
military purchases. The combined sum of Russo-Venezuelan military contracts exceeds 11bn$.

Since 2005, a lot of military equipment has been delivered to Venezuela, among them anti-air defense systems, including "Antey-2500" and
"Buk-M2E", portable air defense systems ("Igla"), SU-30MK destroyers, MI-35M and MI-17 helicopters and also armored machines (T-72 tanks,
BMP-3, BTR-80) and also more than 100k new AK-103 automatic rifles.
