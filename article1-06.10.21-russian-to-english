Construction of the plant for production of AK rifles should conclude in 2022, but the coronavirus is making the situation 
more complicated, an Interfax interviewee from the national defense industry said.

Yesterday a special envoy of the President of Venezuela Adan Chavez declared intention to build the aforementioned factory with
mid-2022 deadline, and he also expressed hope that, that nothing's going to mess up with the construction team's plans this time.

"The issue right now is to end the construction in 2022", he confirmed and noted that their party has to deal with coronavirus
situation right now.

"We should send many specialists and inspectors there, so that after the construction is done, which is also to be inspected, we can
start it up", he explained

ammunition production in Venezuela. Construction site opened in 2009 but since then many government officials complained it got to standstill.
