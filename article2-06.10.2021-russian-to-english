==KHMAO Governor ordered to solve problems with afternoon shift in Khanty-Mansiysk schools==
Reported on Oct, 6, 2021, from Moscow, Interfax

The governor of Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Region (Yugra) Nataliya Komarova delegated to Khanty-Mansiysk mayor, Maksim Ryashin, a task to
reduce the number of school students studying in afternon shifts.

"Khanty-Mansiysk is the anti-leader of when it comes to providing student places in city schools", she said. "More than 45% of all students
study in afternoon shifts. This is the lowest measure among all Yugra settlements and that's why I again put an accent on this issue, as
we need breakthrough solutions for it. There are no other directions to move and make more errors for the city authorities"

Ryashin confirmed, that the city now sits at 22th place in the region, as for school student seat vision rating (??). According to his
words, the city now builds four additional new schools, two of which are to be commenced in 2021. He also added that the city authorities
are planning to build 7 additional schools in the period up to 2025.

In August 2017, the then-Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev supported decision to extend the program to provide more student seats in 
Russian schools, but he also questioned the objective to abandon afternoon shifts altogether. He then weighed in his opinion on the topic,
having said that it is "better to study in two shifts in comfortable schools than to simply claim that everyone is studying in morning shifts,
but schools are badly equipped and thinly staffed"

In summer 2018, the then-Minister of Education Olga Vasilyeva promised to end the evening (third) shift in Russian schools. Then, more than
8,6k students from Dagestan, Buryatiya and Chechnya studied in evening shifts.
