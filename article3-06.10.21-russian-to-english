==State Duma mandate is to be transferred from actor Vladimir Mashkov to director of Pushkin museum==
Reported on Oct 6, 2021, from Moscow, Interfax

The Russian Tsentrizbirkom (Central Election Committee) is going to consider handing a State Duma seat mandate of "United Russia" to the
director of The State Pushkin Museum Evgeny Bogatyryov, transferring the mandate from actor and art director of "Tabakerka" theatre
Vladimir Mashkov.

On 4 Oct, many supposed that Mashkov is going to confirm going to State Duma with this mandate, which was earlier also rejected by the
art director of The Russian Theatre of Nations Mariya Revyakina.

During the hearing, Special Commission  already registered 9 candidates from "United Russia": 7th State Duma congressmen (deputies) Dmitry
Vyatkin, Nikolay Buduev and Vladimir Gutenev and also the co-chair of the central committee of ONF (All-Russia Peoples Front) Elena Tsunaeva,
mediamanager Sergey Lisovsky, Mikhail Kislyakov, Alla Polyakova, Aleksandr Boroday and Renat Ayupov.

Earlier, the chair of Tsentrizbirkom Ella Pamfilova announced that "United Russia" won 324 State Duma mandates of 450, according to State
Duma election results. On Oct 5, the chair of "United Russia" Dmitry Medvedev announced that "United Russia" is going to have 326 seats
instead due to 2 self-nomineed candidates joining "United Russia" fraction. Vladimir Vasilyev is reportedly proposed to lead the fraction.
